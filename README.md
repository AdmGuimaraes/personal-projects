# personal-projects
My personal school projects.

It is a test to include this kind of routine with my friends, at the college. We don't tried GitHub yet, andi think this is a great idea.

We have some homeworks to do, and I'm tired to use TeamViewer or get confused by two models of the same archive. I want to inovate.

So, I don't have too much to say. It' only a test and I hope everyone enjoy.
